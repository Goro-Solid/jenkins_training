Theory:
   Describe types of tests

1. Add Post-Build action to Publish Test results (JUnit)
   **/*TEST*xml

2. Make a change in tests and/or code
3. Set up poll trigger
4. Take up maven project and refactor as for powershell but start with your own repo first


For powershell

5. Install plugin "NUnit"
5. Post-build Actions -> Publish NUnit test results report:
    003_ci/powershell/TEST.xml
